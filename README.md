Automated Scanning &amp; Host Enumeration. A reacon utility for fast, structured, and intelligent target enumeration.

What's the goal? 
I want to automate some of the inital recon process, this stuff I end up copying and pasting from my notes, editing tediously, opening multiple shells to run everything. I'm lazy man.
